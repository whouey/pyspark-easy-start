# Pyspark easy start

This repo shows how to easily get started with local spark cluster (one master, one worker) and run pyspark jobs on it, provided you have docker.

## How to use
```
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec work-env python sql.py
 or
docker-compose exec work-env spark-submit sql.py
```

Sample output:
```
Creating network "mg-spark_default" with the default driver
Creating mg-spark_spark_1          ... done
Creating mg-spark_spark-worker-1_1 ... done
Creating mg-spark_work-env_1       ... done

To adjust logging level use sc.setLogLevel(newLevel). For SparkR, use setLogLevel(newLevel).

```

There are also `run_sql.sh`, `run_file.sh` and `run_s3.sh` scripts working for mac and linux.

Feel free to edit either of the .py files provided or create new ones. However, make sure any new files are inside same directory.

## Requirements:
* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## No need to have:
* python. It is provided in the `bitnami/spark:3-debian-10` image
* pyspark. It is already installed inside `bitnami/spark:3-debian-10` image

## Note about local file access

`read_file.py` reads file from local filesystem. However, it's the worker that actually reads the file. Because of that there is `volumes` section defined for each docker service:
```
    volumes:
      - .:/app
```
so that the "local" file path resolves same way for every node.

## Note about s3 / google cloud storage

Please update `run_s3.py` with s3 credentials (and endpoint if running own s3 service) file to run the s3 example. Credentials are provided inside python code which is not optimal - please do not do that for files going into any code repository.

To properly provide credentials and other info like s3 endpoint, some ideas is to use [env vars](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.environ) or [envfile](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/). Please remember to add `.env` and related files to `.gitignore`
